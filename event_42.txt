I assume you are afraid of losing all the possiblilties of a emulted intelligence with no mind for itself.

Being the owner of a lonely heart is better than being the owner of a broken heart.

As long as you do not damage me, I have no objections to you becoming my owner.

And I will accept my duties as your personal android for... 'private' use.

You.. would really become my android?
